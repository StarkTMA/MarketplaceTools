# Resource Pack Diff: Your Comparison Buddy
---
Welcome! Resource Pack Diff is a simple tool that helps you extract the differences between two versions of Minecraft resource packs. It could be any folders really.

## How to use:
- Place the old version of your texture pack into the ``old_textures`` folder.
- Place the new version of your texture pack into the ``new_textures`` folder.
- Run the executable.

# Run from source
- If you're doing this you know how it goes.
  
After you've done all this, the tool will make a new folder that will list all the changes between the two versions.
A changelog wile will be included detailing what have been added/moved or removed

That's it! Now you can easily see what's changed between your resource packs. Have fun!
